# Student Information Management Software

This repository contains a C program for managing student information, including:

    Storing student data:
        Name
        ID
        Grades in up to 5 courses
        
    Performing various operations:
        Adding new students
        Viewing all student records
        Searching for students by name or ID
        Generating a report of student grades
        Loading student data from a file
        Saving student data to a file

Key features:

    User-friendly menu-driven interface
    Clear input prompts and output formatting
    Basic error handling for file operations
    Efficient use of arrays and structures for data organization

How to use:

    Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
    Run the executable file.
    Follow the on-screen instructions to choose from the available options.

Additional notes:

    The program stores data in memory and does not use a database.
    The maximum number of students that can be stored is 100.
    The maximum length of student names and course names is 40 characters.
    The program uses fixed-width formatting for output, which may not be ideal for all display devices.

Future improvements:

    Implement a database for persistent data storage.
    Enhance error handling and input validation.
    Improve user interface and output formatting.
    Add features for editing student data and deleting student records.
    Allow for more flexibility in course names and grading systems.
